#### 4th
- A Simple C++ Program

  - how to compile a program in the command line [here](https://github.com/dpfurners/CPP/blob/master/README.md#steps-windows-command-prompt)
  - how to compile a program in CLion [here](https://github.com/dpfurners/CPP/blob/master/README.md#steps-clion)
- Input and Output ([docs](https://github.com/dpfurners/CPP/blob/master/02_InputOutput/InputOutput.md))
  - include the `iostream` library
  - use the `std::cout` object to output data
  - use the `std::cin` object to input data
  - use the `std::endl` manipulator to end a line
  - write a simple [code](https://github.com/dpfurners/CPP/blob/master/02_InputOutput/input-output.cpp)

#### 19th
