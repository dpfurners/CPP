## Compiling C++ Code
... is a process of converting source code into machine code

### Steps (Windows Command Prompt)
1. Create a file with the extension `.cpp`
2. Write your code (I'll use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for this)
3. Open the Command Prompt
4. Navigate to the folder where your file is located
5. Type `g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output-filename>`
6. Type `<output-filename>.exe` to run the program

### Steps (CLion)
1. Create a file with the extension `.cpp`
2. Write your code
3. Click on the green play button in the top right corner
