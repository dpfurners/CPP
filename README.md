# C++
I want to learn the C++ Programming Language and want to keep track of my progress in this repo

## Where do I learn from?
I found a tutorial on YT from NESO Academy. If you want to check it out go ahead: 
[C++ Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRh6isJ01MBnbNpV3ZsktSyS)

I found out, that the first tutorial i took was never completed, so many important features were not included.
So I started the Journey again and started with a Tutorial by[The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno):

I learned OOP in C++ by the following video:
[Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0x9eZLix4)

## My current Progress is also documented [here](https://github.com/dpfurners/CPP/blob/master/progress.md).


## Introduction to C++
- ... is a general-purpose programming language
- ... was created by Bjarne Stroustrup (1979)
- ... is an extension of the C programming language
- ... is supported on most of the major platforms
- ... supports data abstraction, object-oriented- and generic-programming

## Compiling C++ Code
... is a process of converting source code into machine code

### Steps (Windows Command Prompt)
1. Create a file with the extension `.cpp`
2. Write your code (I'll use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for this)
3. Open the Command Prompt
4. Navigate to the folder where your file is located
5. Type `g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output-filename>`
6. Type `<output-filename>.exe` to run the program

### Steps (CLion)
1. Create a file with the extension `.cpp`
2. Write your code
3. Click on the green play button in the top right corner
