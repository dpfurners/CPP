# C++ Dictionary

Any Word that might be confusing for me, or a word that needs a description will be listed here.

## M

#### Main Function


    The Main Function is the Entry Point of every Programm.
    If a Programm doesn't provide a Main Function the programm would not compile.
    The function does not have to return any value (default 0).

Example:
```cpp
int main() 
{
    return 0;
}
```

## P

#### Preprocessor Statements

    Statements that start with an # are defined as a Prepocessor Statement.
    These Statements will be executed before the Code will be compiled

| Example | Description                                                 |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| #include | Includes the content of a Header file into the current file |
